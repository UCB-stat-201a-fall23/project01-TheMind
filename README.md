## Stat 201A - Project No1

In this first lab we are going to model the game [The Mind](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind). Here a simple explanation of the game dynamics:

_A deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete different levels in ascending order (1, 2, 3, ...). The ideal number of players is between 4 and 6. In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life._

As you can see, the game is rather simple, but exposes very interesting and anti-intuitive aspects of probability theory. For example, how long do you think you have to wait until playing a card? The first card? How small or large are the gaps between consecutive cards?

## Deliverables

Before the date of the first midterm, your personal repository `student-<username>` should include the contents inside the notebook `Project01-TheMind.ipynb`. It is ok if this notebook is repeated across repositories of students working in the same group, but it is important that each student has its own repository with the notebooks for the projects. You will find the list of thing to do for this first project inside the Jupyter Notebook. 

## Contribution statement

Collaboration is encouraged between students. However, each student will have to submit its own set of solutions in their own repository. At the end of each notebook, you have to add the list of all the people you worked with.
